# Cat-n-Cookie
-is a game created for an university project. I, without any knowledge in game programming, wanted to create code from a beginner to beginners. 
-it's about a cookie (brown square) which jumps over black squares (cat), the score is shown under the playing field. The score is also been shown when you died. 
-the game works... 
-... but there is an unwanted scrollbar which makes it almost impossible to jump correctly (the record had been 3 times). If anyone knows how to fix that nasty little bugger, feel free to correct it!
